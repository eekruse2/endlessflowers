# Endless Flowers

Everyday a new flower image and love quote fill an observer with feelings, thoughts... or maybe nothing. This special someone can archive what resonated with them and leave an optional message so that down the line when they reminise while scrolling through the archvive they can know what struck them.

Images pulled Pexels free API.
